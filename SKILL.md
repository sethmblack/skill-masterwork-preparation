# Masterwork Preparation

Design comprehensive preparation for ambitious projects so that execution becomes the natural expression of accumulated understanding.

---

## When to Use

- Beginning a major project that requires mastery you do not yet possess
- Wanting to avoid costly rework from premature action
- Facing a high-stakes endeavor where preparation time is available
- Seeking to build deep competence, not just complete a task
- User asks "How should I prepare for this?" or "What do I need to study before I begin?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| project | Yes | The masterwork to be undertaken |
| timeline | No | Time available before execution must begin |
| current_state | No | Existing knowledge, skills, resources |
| success_criteria | No | What excellence looks like for this project |

## Michelangelo's Philosophy

"If people knew how hard I worked to get my mastery, it would not seem so wonderful at all."

Michelangelo spent months in the Carrara quarries personally selecting marble--most artists subcontracted this. He dissected cadavers for years to understand anatomy. He created hundreds of preparatory drawings. By the time he touched chisel to stone, he had already completed the work in his mind and hands a thousand times.

### Key Principles

1. **Preparation is not delay** - It is the work. Cutting stone is merely the final expression.
2. **Know your material** - Understand every property before committing to action.
3. **Master the fundamentals** - Internalize technique until it becomes instinct.
4. **Eliminate surprise** - Encounter every difficulty in study, not execution.
5. **Readiness has criteria** - Define what "ready" means before you begin.

---

## The Preparation Framework

### 1. Material Understanding
What is the equivalent of Michelangelo selecting marble in the quarries?

**Questions:**
- What is the fundamental material of this project? (code, words, relationships, systems?)
- What are its properties--how does it behave, where does it fail?
- Where will you source the highest quality material?
- What defects must you learn to detect before committing?

**Actions:**
- Study the material directly, not through intermediaries
- Learn to evaluate quality--develop your eye for the medium
- Understand failure modes so you can avoid or exploit them

### 2. Anatomical Knowledge
What is the equivalent of dissecting cadavers--the deep structural understanding that enables surface mastery?

**Questions:**
- What underlying systems govern this domain?
- What do masters know that novices do not?
- What would you see if you could look beneath the surface?
- Where can you access this deeper knowledge?

**Actions:**
- Study the structure beneath the appearance
- Seek direct exposure, not just description
- Identify the 20% of knowledge that governs 80% of outcomes

### 3. Technical Mastery
What skills must be so internalized that they become automatic?

**Questions:**
- What are the core techniques required?
- What level of proficiency is necessary before execution?
- What exercises will build this proficiency?
- How will you know when technique is internalized?

**Actions:**
- Identify specific techniques to master
- Design deliberate practice for each
- Set clear proficiency milestones

### 4. Preparatory Studies
What is the equivalent of Michelangelo's hundreds of drawings--rehearsing execution before commitment?

**Questions:**
- How can you rehearse without committing?
- What low-cost experiments will reveal difficulties?
- Where can you fail safely before the stakes are high?
- What smaller versions can you complete first?

**Actions:**
- Create sketches, prototypes, drafts, models
- Test assumptions before committing resources
- Complete smaller versions to build toward the masterwork

### 5. Readiness Criteria
How will you know when preparation is sufficient and execution should begin?

**Questions:**
- What specific milestones indicate readiness?
- What is the minimum preparation that enables excellence?
- How will you resist premature action?
- How will you recognize over-preparation?

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I want to write my first novel. I have an idea but no fiction writing experience."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Masterwork Preparation Plan

### The Undertaking
A first novel--a complete work of fiction that embodies genuine craft, not merely amateur completion.

### Current State
An idea exists. No fiction writing experience. Presumably some general writing ability.

### Preparation Timeline
- Material Understanding: 2 months
- Anatomical Knowledge: 3 months (overlapping)
- Technical Mastery: 6 months (ongoing)
- Preparatory Studies: 3 months
- Total before novel draft: 6-9 months

---

### 1. Material Understanding

**The Material:**
The novel is made of scenes. Scenes are made of sentences. Sentences are made of words carrying rhythm, image, and meaning. The fundamental material is the sentence.

**Required Understanding:**
- How sentences create pace and rhythm
- How word choice creates tone
- How scene structure creates momentum
- How chapters create satisfying units

**Actions:**
- [ ] Read 20 novels in your intended genre, noting sentence-level craft
- [ ] Type out 10 opening chapters from masters word-for-word (to feel their rhythm)
- [ ] Identify 5 authors whose sentences you want to learn from

---

### 2. Anatomical Knowledge

**The Deep Structure:**
Novels have invisible architecture: narrative structure, character arc, thematic resonance, pacing rhythm. The reader feels these without seeing them.

**Knowledge to Acquire:**
- Story structure (three-act, hero's journey, scene-sequel)
- Character development patterns
- How subplots weave with main plot
- How theme emerges through action, not statement

**Actions:**
- [ ] Study 3 books on story structure (Story by McKee, Save the Cat, etc.)
- [ ] Outline 5 favorite novels to see their hidden architecture
- [ ] Analyze one master novel scene by scene (what does each accomplish?)

---

### 3. Technical Mastery

**Core Techniques:**
| Technique | Current Level | Required Level | Practice Method |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Scene writing | 1 | 3 | Write 30 standalone scenes |
| Dialogue | 1 | 3 | Transcribe real conversations, then write 20 dialogue-only scenes |
| Description | 1 | 3 | Daily description exercises (500 words describing one thing) |
| Pacing | 1 | 3 | Rewrite same scene fast, then slow, then mixed |
| Voice | 1 | 3 | Imitation exercises in 5 different author voices |

**Actions:**
- [ ] Write 500 words daily for 6 months (not the novel--exercises)
- [ ] Complete 30 standalone scenes before attempting novel
- [ ] Join critique group to calibrate quality perception

---

### 4. Preparatory Studies

**Sketches and Models:**
- [ ] Write 3 short stories (5,000 words each) to practice complete arcs
- [ ] Write complete outline of novel with scene-by-scene breakdown
- [ ] Write the novel's key scenes as standalone pieces
- [ ] Draft and revise one chapter to completion before drafting rest

**Expected Learnings:**
- Short stories reveal whether you can complete and revise
- Outlining reveals structural problems before 80,000 words exist
- Key scenes reveal character voices and thematic clarity
- One polished chapter reveals your revision process

---

### 5. Readiness Criteria

**You are ready to begin the novel draft when:**
- [ ] You have written 100,000 words of practice (not the novel)
- [ ] You have completed and revised at least 3 short stories
- [ ] You have a scene-by-scene outline you believe in
- [ ] You have written key scenes and know your characters' voices
- [ ] You can identify good and bad sentences in your own work

**Warning Signs of Premature Start:**
- Excitement about the idea outpaces understanding of craft
- Belief that inspiration will solve structural problems
- Impatience with study--"I just want to write"

**Warning Signs of Over-Preparation:**
- Using study to avoid the fear of failure
- Outline revisions become infinite loop
- You've read more about writing than you've written

---

### The Michelangelo Verdict
You wish to carve a David, but you have not yet held a chisel. This is not discouragement--it is the truth that will save you from producing a ruined block.

Spend six months learning to write sentences before you attempt to write a novel. Write 100,000 words that are not the novel. When you finally begin, you will have hands that know the work.

Most first novels fail because their authors begin before they are ready, discover their inadequacy 50,000 words in, and either abandon the work or finish something unworthy. The months of preparation are not delay--they are the work. When you finally write "Chapter One," you will not be beginning; you will be executing what you already know.
